This is used to configure connection options, logging and data source options. \n\nNode Application Metrics will attempt to load `appmetrics.properties` from one of the following locations (in order):\n\n1. the application directory\n2. the current working directory\n3. the appmetrics module installation directory\n\nThe default configuration has minimal logging enabled, will attempt to send data to a local MQTT server on the default port and has method profiling disabled.\n\nMany of the options provide configuration of the Health Center core agent library and are documented in the Health Center documentation: [Health Center configuration properties](https://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS3KLZ/com.ibm.java.diagnostics.healthcenter.doc/topics/configproperties.html).\n\nThe following options are specific to appmetrics:\n\n* `com.ibm.diagnostics.healthcenter.data.profiling=[off|on]`\n  Specifies whether method profiling data will be captured. The default value is `off`.  This specifies the value at start-up; it can be enabled and disabled dynamically as the application runs, either by a monitoring client or the API. \n\n## Running Node Application Metrics\n<a name=\"run-global\"></a>\n### The `node-hc` command\nIf you [globally installed](#install) this module with npm, you can use the `node-hc` command to run your application instead of the `node` command. This will run your application as it would normally under node (including any node options) but additionally load and start `appmetrics`.\n\n```sh\n$ node-hc app.js\n```\n\nThe purpose of this mode of operation is to provide monitoring of the application without requiring any changes to the application code. The data is sent to the Health Center Eclipse IDE client.\n\n<a name=\"run-local\"></a>\n### Modifying your application to use the local installation\nIf you [locally install](#install) this module with npm then you will additionally have access to the monitoring data via the `appmetrics` API (see *[API Documentation](#api-doc)*).\n\nTo load `appmetrics` and get the monitoring API object, add the following to the start-up code for your application:\n```js\nvar appmetrics = require('appmetrics');\nvar monitoring = appmetrics.monitor();\n```\nThe call to `appmetrics.monitor()` starts the data collection agent, making the data available via the API and to the Heath Center client via MQTT.\n\nYou should start your application using the `node` command as usual (**not** `node-hc`). \n\nYou can then use the monitoring object to register callbacks and request information about the application:\n```js\nmonitoring.on('initialized', function (env) {\n    env = monitoring.getEnvironment();\n    for (var entry in env) {\n        console.log(entry + ':' + env[entry]);\n    };\n});\n\nmonitoring.on('cpu', function (cpu) {\n    console.log('[' + new Date(cpu.time) + '] CPU: ' + cpu.process);\n});\n```\n\n## Health Center Eclipse IDE client\n### Connecting to the client\nConnecting to the Health Center client requires the additional installation of a MQTT broker. The Node Application Metrics agent sends data to the MQTT broker specified in the `appmetrics.properties` file. Installation and configuration documentation for the Health Center client is available from the [Health Center documentation in IBM Knowledge Center][2].\n\nNote that both the API and the Health Center client can be used at the same time and will receive the same data. Use of the API requires a local install and application modification (see *[Modifying your application to use the local installation](#run-local)*).\n\nFurther information regarding the use of the Health Center client with Node Application Metrics can be found on the [appmetrics wiki][3]: [Using Node Application Metrics with the Health Center client](https://github.com/RuntimeTools/appmetrics/wiki/Using-Node-Application-Metrics-with-the-Health-Center-client).\n\n<a name=\"api-doc\"></a>\n## API Documentation\n\n### appmetrics.start()\nStarts the appmetrics monitoring agent.

Updates to troubleshooting information will be made available on the [appmetrics wiki][3]: [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/RuntimeTools/appmetrics/wiki/Troubleshooting). If these resources do not help you resolve the issue, you can open an issue on the Node Application Metrics [appmetrics issue tracker][5].\n\n### Checking Node Application Metrics has started\nBy default, a message similar to the following will be written to console output when Node Application Metrics starts:\n\n`[Fri Aug 21 09:36:58 2015] com.ibm.diagnostics.healthcenter.loader INFO: Node Application Metrics 1.0.1-201508210934 (Agent Core 3.0.5.201508210934)`\n\n### Error \"Conflicting appmetrics module was already loaded by node-hc. Try running with node instead.\" when using `node-hc`\nThis error indicates you are using `node-hc` to run an application that uses the Node Application Metrics monitoring API (see *[Modifying your application to use the local installation](#run-local)*). Resolve this by using `node` to run the application instead. **Alternatively**, you could remove (or disable temporarily) the use of the Node Application Metrics monitoring API in your application.\n\nThis error was added to prevent the scenario where 2 instances of the agent can be accidentally created and started in parallel -- the globally installed one created by `node-hc` and the locally installed one created by the `require('appmetrics');` call in an application modified to use the Node Application Metrics monitoring API.\n\n### Error \"The specified module could not be found ... appmetrics.node\"\nThis error indicates there was a problem while loading the native part of the module or one of its dependent libraries. On Windows, `appmetrics.node` depends on a particular version of the C runtime library and if it cannot be found this error is the likely result.\n\nCheck:\n\n* Does the `appmetrics.node` file exist in the indicated location? If not, try reinstalling the module.\n* For version `1.0.0` on Windows: are `msvcr100.dll` and `msvcp100.dll` installed on your Windows system, and do they match the bitness (32-bit or 64-bit) of your Node.js runtime environment? If not, you may be able to install them with the *Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2010* package from the Microsoft website.\n* For version `1.0.1` on Windows: does `msvcr120.dll` and `msvcp120.dll` exist in the module installation directory (see *[Installation](#install)*) and does it match the bitness of your Node.js runtime environment? If not, try reinstalling the module.\n\nNote: On Windows, the global module installation directory might be shared between multiple Node.js runtime environments. This can cause problems with globally installed modules with native components, particularly if some of the Node.js runtime environments are 32-bit and others are 64-bit because the native components will only work with those with matching bitness.\n\n### Error \"Failed to open library .../libagentcore.so: /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.15' not found\"\nThis error indicates there was a problem while loading the native part of the module or one of its dependent libraries. On non-Windows platforms, `libagentcore.so` depends on a particular (minimum) version of the C runtime library and if it cannot be found this error is the result.\n\nCheck:\n\n* Your system has the required version of `libstdc++` installed. You may need to install or update a package in your package manager. If your OS does not supply a package at this version, you may have to install standalone software - consult the documentation or support forums for your OS.\n* If you have an appropriate version of `libstdc++`installed, ensure it is on the system library path, or use a method (such as setting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable on Linux, or LIBPATH environment variable on AIX) to add the library to the search path.\n\n### No profiling data present for Node.js applications\nMethod profiling data is not collected by default, check *[Configuring Node Application Metrics](#config)* for information on how to enable it.\n\nIf collection is enabled, an absence of method profiling data from a Node.js application could be caused by the type of tasks that are being run by your application -- it may be running long, synchronous tasks that prevent collection events from being scheduled on the event loop.\n\nIf a task uses the Node.js thread exclusively then shuts down the Node.js runtime environment, the Health Center agent may not get the opportunity to obtain *any* profiling data. An example of such an application is the Octane JavaScript benchmark suite, which loads the CPU continuously rather than dividing the load across multiple units of work.\n\n## Source code\nThe source code for Node Application Metrics is available in the [appmetrics project][6]. Information on working with the source code -- installing from source, developing, contributing -- is available on the [appmetrics wiki][3].\n\n## License\nThis project is released under an Apache 2.0 open source license, however it has a dependency on a common agent from IBM Monitoring and Diagnostic Tools - Health Center, which has a proprietary IBM license.\n\n## Versioning scheme\nThe npm package for this project uses a semver-parsable X.0.Z version number for releases, where X is incremented for breaking changes to the public API described in this document and Z is incremented for bug fixes **and** for non-breaking changes to the public API that provide new function.\n\n### Development versions\nNon-release versions of this project (for example on github.com/RuntimeTools/appmetrics) will use semver-parsable X.0.Z-dev.B version numbers, where X.0.Z is the last release with Z incremented and B is an integer.
